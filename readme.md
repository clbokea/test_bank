# Bank Example
An example of Object Oriented Analysis, Design and Programming.   
Shows the way from the _problem description_ over [_Use Case Diagram_](#use-case-diagram), [_Use Cases_](#use-cases), 
[_System Sequence Diagram_](#system-sequence-diagram), [_Noun List_](#noun-list), [_Domain Model_](#domain-model), 
[_Verb List_](#verb-list), [_Class Diagram_](#class-diagram) to the actual [_Java Code_](#code).    

This is a step by step Technique for getting from a well written _Use Case_ to the actual _Code_ without 
"guessing", "thinking" or just creating a class out of the blue. If a Use Case is well written it will decide 
exactly what classes, attribuetes and methods will apear in the final code.  

In this repository you will find **_Tasks_**, and when you have solved the tasks the solution for these tasks will be added. You can browse through the tasks and solutions in the _Tag_ menu, in the top left of this page.
